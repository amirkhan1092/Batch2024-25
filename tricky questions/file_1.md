**1. Reverse Integer Without Converting to String**

**Story**:  
KD is working on a financial application that requires reversing numbers, but for security reasons, the system doesn't allow converting numbers to strings. KD needs a way to reverse an integer's digits while keeping it in numeric form.

**Problem**:  
Write a Python program to reverse an integer without converting it to a string. The program should handle positive and negative integers.

**Example**:
```python
Input: 123
Output: 321

Input: -456
Output: -654
```

**2. Subtraction Without Using the Subtraction Operator**

**Story**:  
In a coding challenge, KD is asked to perform subtraction between two numbers without directly using the subtraction operator (`-`). Instead, he must find a creative way to subtract numbers using bitwise or other operations.

**Problem**:  
Write a Python function to subtract two integers without using the subtraction operator.

**Example**:
```python
Input: 10, 3
Output: 7

Input: 5, 12
Output: -7
```

**3. Numberless Count to 100**

**Story**:  
KD's programming team is trying to print numbers from 1 to 100 in a unique way. However, they aren't allowed to use any numeric literals in their code.

**Problem**:  
Write a Python program to print numbers from 1 to 100 without using any numeric literals directly in the code.

**Example**:
```python
Output: 
1
2
3
...
100
```

**4. Determine if a Number is Positive or Negative Without Comparison Operators**

**Story**:  
KD is creating a program that checks if a number is positive or negative. However, he cannot use any comparison operators such as `<`, `>`, or `==`.

**Problem**:  
Write a Python function to determine if a number is positive, negative, or zero without using comparison operators.

**Example**:
```python
Input: 5
Output: Positive

Input: -3
Output: Negative

Input: 0
Output: Zero
```

**5. Print "Thalaivaa" Without Using Any Vowels**

**Story**:  
In a unique challenge, KD needs to print the word “Thalaivaa” but without using any vowels (A, E, I, O, U, a, e, i, o, u) in the code itself.

**Problem**:  
Write a Python program to print "Thalaivaa" without directly including any vowel characters in the code.

**Example**:
```python
Output:
Thalaivaa
```
